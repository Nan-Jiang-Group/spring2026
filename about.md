# Course Description

This course provides a hands-on introduction to modern deep learning, moving from core concepts (tensors, optimization, and neural network training) to practical model families used across science and industry. 

Students will build intuition and implementation skills in PyTorch, study key architectures including MLPs, CNNs, autoencoders, GANs, autoregressive models, and transformers.

The course also connects these methods to real-world applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and large language models, with attention to efficient inference and post-training workflows.

## AI Policy for the Deep Learning course

Students are permitted to use AI assistants for all homework and programming assignments (especially as a reference for understanding any topics that seem confusing), but we strongly encourage you to complete your final submitted version of your assignment without AI.
